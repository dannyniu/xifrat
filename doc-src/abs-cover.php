  <p>
    This paper proposes a new public-key cryptosystem based on
    a quasigroup with the special property of "restricted-commutativity".
    We argue its security empirically and present constructions for
    key exchange and digital signature. To the best of our knowledge,
    our primitive and construction have no known polynomial-time attack
    from quantum computers yet.

  <p>
    The proposed cryptosystem along with the reference implementation
    are released to the public domain.
