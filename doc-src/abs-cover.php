<div class=abstract>
  <p>
    In this paper, we propose a new public-key cryptosystem based on
    a quasigroup with the special property of "restricted-commutativity".
    We argue its security empirically and present constructions for
    key exchange and digital signature. To the best of our knowledge,
    our primitive and construction have no known polynomial-time attack
    from quantum computers yet.
  </p>

  <p>
    We note that quasigroups with such property had been independently
    proposed for use in public-key cryptography and termed
    "entropic" quasigroups or "entropoids" by D.Gligoroski.
  </p>

  <p>
    The proposed cryptosystem along with the reference implementation
    are released to the public domain.
