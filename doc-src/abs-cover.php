    Xifrat was a group-theoretic public-key cryptosystem based on
    a quasigroup with the special property of "restricted-commutativity".
    It was broken within half a month of its publication, due to a mistake
    made in the "mixing" function.

    In this paper, we revisit the design decisions made, proposing new
    constructions, and attempt (again) to build secure digital signature
    schemes and key encapsulation mechanisms.
  </p>

  <p>
    If the schemes can be proven secure, then this will be
    the most compact and the most efficient post-quantum
    cryptosystem ever proposed to date.
